# Changelog

All notable changes to Apex will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.20] - 2025-12-11

#### NEW

- Added man page generation and installation support. Man pages can be generated from Markdown source using pandoc or go-md2man, with pre-generated man pages included in the repository as fallback. CMake build system now handles man page installation, and Homebrew formula installs the man page.
- Added comprehensive test suite for MMD 6 features including multi-line setext headers and link/image titles with different quote styles (single quotes, double quotes, parentheses). Tests verify these features work in both MultiMarkdown and unified modes.
- Added build-test man_page_copy target for man page installation.
- Added --obfuscate-emails flag to hex-encode mailto links.

#### IMPROVED

- Superscript processing now stops at sentence terminators (. , ; : ! ?) instead of including them in the superscript content. This prevents punctuation from being incorrectly included in superscripts.
- Enhanced subscript and underline detection logic. The processor now correctly differentiates between subscript (tildes within a word, e.g., H~2~O) and underline (tildes at word boundaries, e.g., ~text~) by checking if tildes are within alphanumeric words or at word boundaries.
- Expanded test coverage for superscript, subscript, underline, strikethrough, and highlight features with additional edge case tests.
- Email autolink detection trims trailing punctuation.

#### FIXED

- Autolink now only wraps real URLs/emails instead of every word.
- Email autolinks now use mailto: hrefs instead of bare text.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.19] - 2025-12-09

#### CHANGED

- HTML comments now replaced with "raw HTML omitted" in CommonMark and GFM modes by default
- Added enable_sup_sub flag to apex_options struct
- Updated mode configurations to enable sup/sub in appropriate modes
- Added sup_sub.c to CMakeLists.txt build configuration
- Removed unused variables to resolve compiler warnings
- Tag filter (GFM security feature) now only applies in GFM mode, not Unified mode, allowing raw HTML and autolinks in Unified mode as intended.
- Autolink extension registration now respects the enable_autolink option flag.

#### NEW

- Added MultiMarkdown-style superscript (^text^) and subscript (~text~) syntax support
- Added --[no-]sup-sub command-line option to enable/disable superscript/subscript
- Superscript/subscript enabled by default in unified and MultiMarkdown modes
- Created sup_sub extension (sup_sub.c and sup_sub.h) for processing ^ and ~ syntax
- Added --[no-]unsafe command-line option to control raw HTML handling
- Added test_sup_sub() function with 13 tests covering superscript and
- Added test_mixed_lists() function with 10 tests covering mixed list
- Added test_unsafe_mode() function with 8 tests covering raw HTML
- Added preprocessing for angle-bracket autolinks (<http://...>) to convert them to explicit markdown links, ensuring they work correctly with custom rendering paths.
- Added --[no-]autolink CLI option to control automatic linking of URLs and email addresses. Autolinking is enabled by default in GFM, MultiMarkdown, Kramdown, and unified modes, and disabled in CommonMark mode.
- Added enable_autolink field to apex_options structure to control autolink behavior programmatically.
- Added underline syntax support: ~text~ now renders as <u>text</u> when there's a closing ~ with no space before it.

#### IMPROVED

- Test suite now includes 36 additional tests, increasing total test
- Autolink preprocessing now skips processing inside code spans (`...`) and code blocks (```...```), preventing URLs from being converted to links when they appear in code examples.
- Metadata replacement retains HTML edge-case handling and properly cleans up intermediate buffers.

#### FIXED

- Unified mode now correctly enables mixed list markers and alpha lists by default when no --mode is specified
- ^ marker now properly separates lists by creating a paragraph break instead of just blank lines
- Empty paragraphs created by ^ marker are now removed from final HTML output
- Superscript and subscript processing now skips ^ and ~ characters
- Superscript processing now skips ^ when part of footnote reference
- Subscript processing now skips ~ when part of critic markup patterns
- Setext headers are no longer broken when followed by highlight syntax (==text==). Highlight processing now stops at line breaks to prevent interference with header parsing.
- Metadata parser no longer incorrectly treats URLs and angle-bracket autolinks as metadata. Lines containing < or URLs (http://, https://, mailto:) are now skipped during metadata extraction.
- Superscript/subscript processor now correctly differentiates between ~text~ (underline), ~word (subscript), and ~~text~~ (strikethrough). Double-tilde sequences are skipped so strikethrough extension can handle them.
- Subscript processing now stops at sentence terminators (. , ; : ! ?) instead of including them in the subscript content.
- Metadata variable replacement now runs before autolinking so [%key] values containing URLs are turned into links when autolinking is enabled.
- MMD metadata parsing no longer incorrectly rejects entries with URL values; only URL-like keys or '<' characters in keys are rejected, allowing "URL: https://example.com" as valid metadata.
- Headers starting with `#` are now correctly recognized instead of being treated as autolinks. The autolink preprocessor now skips `#` at the start of a line when followed by whitespace.
- Math processor now validates that `\(...\)` sequences contain actual math content (letters, numbers, or operators) before processing them. This prevents false positives like `\(%\)` from being treated as math when they only contain special characters.
